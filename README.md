## Hey there, I’m Ajay!

Welcome to my code jungle.

I’ve probably caused more segmentation faults than there are alligators in Gainesville. I’ve stared down cursed stack traces, unresponsive frontends, race conditions that only happen sometimes, and hours wondering why nothing works before realizing I was in the wrong directory. Still here. Still coding.

Over time, I’ve built full-stack apps, cloud pipelines, dev tools no one asked for, and squashed more bugs than I’d like to admit (lost count somewhere around 500). Every project has left behind a lesson or a scar — the kind that actually sticks and shapes how I build today. Feel free to explore the chaos; most of it runs surprisingly well.

- **Custom WAD File System with FUSE Integration**  
  Created a working file system in C++ from the ground up — the same core technology your computer uses every day to organize files and folders. Implemented directory creation, file storage, and data retrieval inside WAD archives, then connected it to FUSE so it could be mounted and browsed just like a real operating system’s file system.

- **CrashFatalityAnalysis**  
  Analyze real vehicle fatality data from 1996 to 2022 with this dynamic dashboard. It enables you to explore fatality rates by make, model, and year, helping identify vehicles with the highest fatality rates and uncover discrepancies in crash ratings. Ideal for researchers and anyone interested in evaluating the real-world safety of vehicles beyond official ratings.
  
- **VehicleInsightHub**  
  Unlocks powerful vehicle monitoring with a live, easy-to-use dashboard that gives you the full picture in seconds. From tracking fuel efficiency to keeping an eye on tire pressure and engine health, this tool turns raw data into clear, actionable insights. Whether you’re managing a fleet or just love your car, it’s your go-to hub for smarter decisions and hassle-free maintenance!

- **BalanceTree**  
  Optimizes data management with an AVL Tree that self-balances for fast, efficient operations. Handle inserts, deletes, and lookups with ease and speed. Ideal for anyone needing top-notch performance in data structures.
  
- **CLI-PhotoEditor**  
  Crafted a robust command-line tool that transforms images like a pro. From flipping and rotating to resizing TGA files, this tool handles multiple images at once, making bulk edits a breeze. Ideal for anyone needing powerful image manipulation without the fuss of a GUI.

- **Minesweeper**  
  Brought the classic Minesweeper game to life with a sleek graphical interface. Dive into the game where you can flag mines, reveal hidden cells, and tackle increasingly challenging boards. Perfect for those who love a good strategic puzzle with a visual twist.

- **Pakudex**  
  Reimagined the Pokémon universe in a command-line adventure. Manage and evolve your unique Pakuri creatures, adding new ones and listing them with ease. This project captures the fun of Pokémon in a CLI format, perfect for fans of retro gaming with a tech twist.

- **Blackjack**  
  Recreated the thrill of Blackjack in a command-line simulation. This project packs all the excitement of card dealing, dealer strategies, and player decisions into a simple CLI game. Experience the high stakes and strategic play of Blackjack right from your terminal.

- **Sudoku**  
  Transformed the classic Sudoku puzzle into an engaging GUI experience. Solve puzzles with interactive features like drag-and-drop and real-time validation. This version makes solving Sudoku not just a challenge but a visually captivating and interactive experience.
