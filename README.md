- ### Work Experience
  - **Software Engineering Intern**
    - **Robotics for All**
    - Palo Alto, California, United States
    - *Mar 2022 - Jan 2023 (11 months)*
    - As a software engineering intern, I had the opportunity to use JavaScript to automate backend processes at Robotics for All, such as adding new members to the company and gathering users' contact information. As a result, when a parent registers their child for a teaching session using a Google Form, their information automatically gets stored in a database that sends emails and other pertinent information to the respective parties.

  - **Research Assistant**
      - **Florida Institute for Cybersecurity Research**
      - Gainesville, Florida, United States
      - *May 2023 - May 2024 (1 year 1 month)*
      - In my role as a research assistant, I aided in a research team devoted to uncovering potential security flaws in large language models. I collaborated with a PhD student to develop and employ plug-ins tailored to assess the robustness of ChatGPT and similar AI models. My work involved meticulously studying the intricacies of language models, analyzing data, and crafting methods to identify and address potential vulnerabilities effectively.
   
  - **Search Engine Optimization Analyst**
      - **Shiva Robotics Academy**
      - Jacksonville, Florida, United States
      - *Jun 2020 - Jul 2020 (2 months)*
      - I collaborated with the business owner to enhance the company's online presence through strategic Search Engine Optimization (SEO) initiatives.
